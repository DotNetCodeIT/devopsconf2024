In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, the emergence of platform engineering marks a significant stride toward optimizing developer experiences and operational efficiency. This session is designed to guide attendees through the foundational principles of platform engineering, and how they can be effectively implemented using the Azure Developer Platform.
Platform engineering, rooted in the core tenets of DevOps, aims to enhance each development team's capability in terms of security, compliance, cost management, and acceleration of time-to-business value. By fostering a product-based mindset and providing developers with an array of tools and systems, platform engineering empowers teams to achieve high levels of autonomy and agility within a secure, well-governed framework.
